# Naive Counter Complexity Analysis

## Dependencies

The testing is done with matplotlib python library

``` pip install matplotlib```

## Usage

Run from ```naive-instances/``` directory

```./graph.bash```

This will iterate through all ```.bul``` files in current repository and plot the real time against number of verticies into a .png file. 

## Current Results

```naive_vertex.png```:

## Future Suggestions

It is possible to creat thousands of instances by writing a script that translates information from CSV file into bule encodings and using those to run under ```graph.bash``` to yield a more accurate and reliable result.
