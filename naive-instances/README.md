# Naive Counter Complexity Analysis

## Dependencies

The testing is done with matplotlib python library

``` pip install matplotlib```

## Usage

Run from ```naive-instances/``` directory

```./graph.bash```

This will iterate through all ```.bul``` files in current repository and plot the real time against number of verticies into a .png file. 

## Current Results
